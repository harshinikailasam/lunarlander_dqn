🚀 LunarLander Deep Q-Learning Agent

A reinforcement learning project that implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train an agent to solve the LunarLander-v3 environment.
The project focuses on understanding and implementing core DQN concepts rather than model racing or hyperparameter optimization.

🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates how an agent can learn optimal behavior through interaction with an environment using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Instead of relying on tabular Q-learning, the agent uses a neural network to approximate Q-values, enabling learning in a continuous state space.

Key goals of the project:
	•	Understand how Deep Q-Learning works end-to-end
	•	Implement experience replay and target networks for stable training
	•	Observe how exploration–exploitation trade-offs affect learning

🧠 Core Concepts Implemented
	•	Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
	•	Experience Replay
	•	Target Networks with Soft Updates
	•	ε-greedy Exploration Strategy
	•	Batch-based Learning with PyTorch
	•	Reward-based Convergence Monitoring

These techniques are essential for stabilizing learning in deep reinforcement learning environments.

🌍 Environment
	•	Environment: LunarLander-v3 (Gymnasium)
	•	State Space:
8 continuous variables representing position, velocity, angle, and contact sensors
	•	Action Space:
4 discrete actions controlling the lander’s thrusters
	•	Goal:
Achieve a safe landing between the flags with minimal fuel usage
